                    Characterizing Formative Assessment Practices of Learning Assistants: An Authoritative-to-Dialogic Spectrum </h3>
                <p>Senior thesis project submitted to Tufts University Department of Chemistry. Published in the International Journal of STEM Education. Link available <a href="https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-023-00429-4">here</a>. Awarded highest thesis honors.</p>
                <p>Abstract: Learning assistants (LAs) increase accessibility to instructor-student interactions in large lecture classes. The Formative Assessment Enactment Model (FAEM) can characterize LA facilitation practices during these interactions in a holistic way. The FAEM encompasses the actions, purposes, and perspectives that influence instructor actions. The model describes facilitation practices as eliciting or advancing student thinking, guided by their purposes as well as by what they notice about and how they interpret student thinking. Eliciting and advancing moves can be enacted either in authoritative ways, driven by one perspective that has authority, or in dialogic ways, driven by multiple perspectives. Dialogic practices are of particular interest because of their potential to empower students and center student thinking. In this study, we collected data from 37 introductory science lectures’ LAs during small group discussions at two different universities, 22 of which were chemistry LAs. Data consisted of video recordings of LA-student interactions during lectures and stimulated recall interviews with the LAs. We find that LA actions exist along a spectrum of authoritative to dialogic based on the perspectives centered. Using examples from chemistry, we report on this spectrum that further adds to theory around authoritative and dialogic practices as it reconsiders what perspectives can drive LA enactment of facilitation other than the perspective of canonically correct science and the perspectives of the students involved in the discussion. This emerging characterization may be used to give LAs a tool to intentionally shift between authoritative and dialogic practices during small group discussions. It may also be used to transition towards more student-centered practices. </p>

                <h3>Epigenetic Effects off Nicotine</h3>
                <p>Class project discussing the epigenetic effects of nicotine. See the link <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/epigeneticnicotine">here</a> (only accessible to fellow Jumbos!).</p>
                <p>Perinatal nicotine exposure can result in several epigenetic changes which damage heart function. Many of these effects are centered around down-regulation of Ca2+ activated K+ channels. These large calcium-gated potassium channels are present in almost all mammalian cell types. Nicotine acts to decrease BKCa channel amounts through over-expression of micro ribonucleic acid-181a. It also down-regulates BKCa by elevating DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A levels in cardiac cells. These changes both specifically target the β1 subunit of the protein.
                    This combination of epigenetic outcomes has been shown to measurably decrease BKCa expression in cardiac tissue. The lack of BKCa channels causes increased vascular tone which is linked to heart disease. Additionally, it can lead to development of an ischemic sensitive phenotype, left ventricular injury, and slower recovery of LV function after injury.
